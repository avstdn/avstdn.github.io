        <h1>Hey, I'm Alexey.</h1>
        <h2>I'm a design-minded, detail oriented software engineer passionate about combining beautiful code with beautiful design.</h2>
        <h3>I'm a twenty six year student at Bauman Moscow State Technical University studying computer science and interaction design. I have experience developing and designing products for the web, from simple landing pages to multi-tier web applications. I strive to create software that not only functions efficiently under the hood, but also provides intuitive, pixel-perfect user experiences.</h3>
        <h3>I love finding new and better ways to create seamless user experiences with clean, efficient, and scalable code. I consider work an ongoing education, and I'm always looking for opportunities to work with those who are willing to share their knowledge as much as I want to learn. At the end of the day, my primary goal is to create something beautiful with people that bring out the best in me.</h3>
        <h3>When I'm not in front of a screen, I'm probably snowboarding, swimming, petting dog, or learning a new song on my guitar.</h3>
